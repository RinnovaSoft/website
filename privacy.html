        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          This app is developed by RinnovaSoft. We do not collect any personal data and respect your privacy. Below you can read exactly how we handle data.

        <h2>Data Storage</h2>
        <p>
          This app does not collect or process any personal data. All game data, settings, and statistics are stored locally on your device only via internal storage (AsyncStorage). We do not have access to this data, and it is not shared or transmitted to external servers.
        </p>

        <h2>Internet Connection</h2>
        <p>
          The app does not require account registration and does not collect personal data. However, it uses an internet connection to show ads (via Google AdMob) and to verify premium purchases (via your app store’s payment system). Aside from the necessary communication for these functions, no data is sent or stored. There is no tracking, analytics, or data linking to external services active.
        </p>

        <h2>Ads and Consent</h2>
        <p>
          When you use the app, you will be asked to give consent for personalized ads via Google AdMob. This consent request is managed through Google’s official consent form (User Messaging Platform). You can change your choice at any time via the app’s settings menu. If you do not give consent, only non-personalized ads will be shown.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Voice-Over Function</h2>
        <p>
          The voice feature uses your device’s text-to-speech functionality. Everything happens locally: nothing is recorded, sent, or stored. The app does not use a microphone.
